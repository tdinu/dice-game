The Pig Game

GAME RULES

- the game has two players, playing in rounds
- in each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his round score
- BUT if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- the player can choose to 'hold', which means that his round score gets added to his global score. After that, it's next player's turn
- the first player to reach 100 points on global wins the game
